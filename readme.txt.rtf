\f0\fs24 \cf2 At a high level, my project is supposed to be Scrabble with AI integrated into it. Essentially the user can play Scrabble against the computer with scores, shuffle and pass options, and all the rules of typical Scrabble. Used the module PyEnchant as a dictionary module, which will need to be installed, and a text file containing 100,000 words which served as another dictionary. The text file is included in my zip file and the PyEnchant module can be installed using pip. \
